This contains the code to analyze the results of our nanog paper.

Steps to use it:

1. clone this repository on your local drive.

2. get the packed data and unpack it somewhere. It should contain subdirectories:

inputdata
outputdata
intermediate_results
externaldata

3. Make symbolic links from within the repository directory (from 1) to each of the
subdirectories of the unpacked data.

Example shell commands would be:

$  cd nanogRepository

$  ln -s path/To/UnpackedData/inputdata inputdata

... and the same for the other subdirectories.


4. use linux/GNU "make" from the command line within the nanogRepository.

Just typing:

$  make
or
$  make allFigures


will cause all figures (all the content in the outputdata directory) to be remade.

If you only want to re-make a particular figure, you can choose from the targets that are displayed
if you run this command:

$  make -pn | perl -F: -ane 'print "$F[0]\n" if /^\w+\s*:/' | sort

For example:

$  make figureFISH

To start from a clean slate in terms of the output directory:

$  make cleanOutput

and then you can make the figures again.


To redo all the intermediate calculations, some of which are very lengthy, 
(~ 1 hour a piece for DESeq calculations and certain bioinformatics database queries)
run :

$  make cleanIntermediates

and then run make without arguments.
